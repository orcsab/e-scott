      <h2>Scott's Intel Stories</h2>

      <p>I've been working at Intel since May of 1998. Among many mostly boring stories, one is worth telling. As in intern in 1998 I was playing around with a facility on Intel's web-based phonebook service. This interface allowed me to provide a nickname that had generally no purpose. I guess the idea here was so that so an Indian or Chinese worker could simplify their traditionally impossible-for-a-white-dude-to-pronounce names like "Chandravishwasanjasakar" or "Xyiozuo" to "Chandra" or "Bob".</p>

      <p>Thinking this little nickname feature was generally unused, I put in a poorly thought out "Super Geek" for myself. Basically this was a joke just for me since no one seemed to know I had done this.</p>

      <p>Little by little, it seemed that Intel seemed to accept these nicknames. As I'd call TAC (our phone-based PC help center) I'd start to here things like "Am I speaking with Super Geek?" when they read my nickname. Then, one time when I ordered a piece of software to be delivered to my cube it was delivered to "Super Geek Drummonds". Heh. Suddenly this joke has got some legs.</p>

      <p>Five years into my employment, Intel provides a little catalog of $50 presents to reward you for a half a million dollars worth of labor. Most choose the watch, as did I. <p>

      <p>"Ah, that's a nice piece of crap," I say to myself, "I'm sure that I can regift this badboy for some serious familial props." I go ahead and give the thing the once over before shipping it off. And what is it, that after five years of devoted service, Intel has decided to engrave on the back of the watch? I short word on the achievement of the watch's lucky recipient.</p>

      <p>That'll teach me to fuck with the man.</p>
